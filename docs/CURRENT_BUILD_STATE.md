# NIOV Foundation — Current Build State

**Status:** Persistent canonical reference. Updated as build
progresses. Future Claude Code sessions should view this document
at session start to load current build state regardless of
conversation context loss.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-08 (initial landing alongside
`docs/reconciliation/2026-05-08-build-reconciliation.md`)

---

## Section 1 — One-paragraph summary

NIOV Foundation is the **AI Memory Governance Substrate** — the
patented infrastructure layer between language models and enterprise
institutional memory. The **Contextual Orchestration and Scoped
Memory Protocol (COSMP)** governs seven primitive operations on AI
memory; the **Decentralized Memory Wallet (DMW)** holds that memory
as cryptographically-governed capsules owned by the enterprise.
Foundation is **deployment-target agnostic** (managed cloud,
sovereign cloud, on-premise, air-gapped) per ADR-0018, **post-quantum-
ready by primitive selection** per ADR-0019, and runs underneath
**Otzar** (the first canonical application) and any future
enterprise or government applications. Three issued US patents
protect the architecture: **12,164,537** (Dec 2024), **12,399,904**
(Aug 2025), **12,517,919** (Jan 2026).

## Section 12 — Recommended Architectural Additions

Six forward-tracked architectural additions surfaced during the
2026-05-08 session. Each is captured here for dedicated future-session
investigation + design + ADR. **None are designed today;** this section
captures scoped concerns + research-grounded framings.

### 12.1 Multi-tenant federation architecture

**Concern:** Enterprise customers like Nike (with Nike USA, Nike
Japan, Nike Dubai as separate legal entities) need separate
sovereign data per tenant + admins + employees, with optional
consent-gated parent-org roll-up intelligence.

**Current state:**

- Foundation has organization-scoped entities, RBAC infrastructure,
  audit-chain enforcement, cross-org leak prevention (ADR-0006).
- Single-org multi-entity is built.
- Cross-org isolation is built.
- Cross-tenant federation (consent-gated parent-org intelligence) is
  NOT yet built.

**Research findings (2026-05-08):**

- Salesforce uses single shared multitenant database + multitenant
  kernel + OrgID partitioning at every query layer.
- Salesforce Hyperforce overlay provides per-region data residency
  (US / EU / UK / Germany / India / Japan / UAE / etc.).
- Salesforce treats Nike-USA / Nike-Japan / Nike-Dubai as separate
  ORGS within their respective regional Hyperforce instances.
- Industry assessment: "Hyperforce provides data residency at the
  country level, but does not natively support country-specific data
  isolation within a single org. Multinational enterprises must
  carefully consider their approach to data residency and
  cross-border data flows."
- Three-tier multi-tenant model categories: shared database / shared
  schema; shared database / separate schemas; separate databases per
  tenant.

**Recommended architecture for Foundation:**

- Per-region Foundation deployments for sovereign data residency
  (matches Hyperforce regional pattern).
- Within each regional deployment: multi-tenant kernel with strong
  tenant isolation (each subsidiary = own tenant, OrgID partitioning,
  RBAC + ABAC enforcement).
- Optional federation layer for parent-organization roll-up
  intelligence with explicit per-tenant consent gates and audit
  trails.

This is stronger than Salesforce's current native offering.
**Differentiator opportunity.**

**Recommended addition:** NEW ADR + scope work. Likely substantial
implementation cycle.

### 12.2 Capsule + COSMP + DMW interconnection map

**Concern:** Bilateral relationships between capsules, COSMP
operations, and DMW wallets are documented across multiple Build
Guide sections (1, 3, 5) but not surfaced as a single coherent
picture. The governance topology (how capsules flow through COSMP
operations within DMW boundaries) needs unified documentation.

**Current state:**

- Substrate is built (Sections 1, 3, 5 closed).
- `docs/reference/architectural-anchors.md` referenced in CLAUDE.md
  but flagged as having "mild secondary drift" deferred to Sub-box 7
  work.
- No single canonical interconnection map exists.

**Recommended addition:** Documentation work only. Single canonical
document showing full lifecycle:

- Capsule creation → 7-layer assembly → wallet assignment.
- COSMP 7 operations operating on capsules.
- DMW 3 wallet types holding capsules.
- Bilateral relationships: capsule ↔ wallet ↔ entity ↔ governance.
- Cross-references to ADRs and Build Guide sections.

**Effort:** ~2-4 hours documentation. No new substrate work
required.

### 12.3 Digital twin behavior specification

**Concern:** Specific agent behaviors not yet fully specified:

- Listeners + click-watching + workflow learning.
- Permission temporality model (short-term, long-term, indefinite).
- Cross-departmental collaboration rules (when does Twin A from
  Marketing get to ask Twin B from Engineering for context, governed
  by what?).
- After-hours autonomous operation with deferred permission
  requests.
- Federated learning across twins within an org.
- Twin portability when employee changes companies.

**Current state:**

- Section 11 (Otzar Conversation + Context Priming + Observation) —
  CLOSED (observation pipeline built).
- Section 14 (Autonomous Execution + Proactive Behaviors) —
  NOT STARTED.
- Section 16 (Otzar Product Completeness — federated learning, twin
  portability) — NOT STARTED.
- Section 17 (Intelligence Engine 6-Layer Stack) — NOT STARTED.

Behaviors above are partially in Section 14 / 16 / 17 scope but at
insufficient granularity. Specific gaps:

- Permission temporality model (short / long / indefinite) needs
  explicit ADR.
- Cross-departmental collaboration rules need explicit specification
  (RBAC + ABAC interaction with twin-to-twin requests).
- After-hours autonomous operation with deferred permission requests
  needs specification.

**Recommended addition:** NEW ADR for permission temporality + scope
expansion in Sections 14 / 16. Some new substrate work required
(permission temporality model, twin-to-twin collaboration gateway,
deferred permission queue).

### 12.4 LLM provider partnership architecture

**Concern:** Foundation should be positioned as valuable
intermediary for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.),
not as competitor. Need explicit architecture for:

- Model-agnostic routing (multi-LLM support per enterprise customer
  choice).
- No-train contractual commitments and technical enforcement.
- PII-stripping pipeline (Foundation produces clean data for LLM
  consumption).
- Allowlist enforcement at gateway (admin-controlled provider
  allowlists).

**Current state:**

- Foundation is LLM-provider-agnostic by design (substrate doesn't
  pick the LLM).
- LLM provider integration patterns not yet architected as explicit
  substrate component.
- PII-stripping happens implicitly via capsule governance but not
  surfaced as discrete pipeline.

**Research findings (2026-05-08):**

- Enterprise LLM gateways (Bifrost, Kong AI Gateway, Cloudflare AI
  Gateway, LiteLLM, OpenRouter) all emerging in 2026.
- 2026 enterprise procurement standards: GPAI deployer transparency,
  use-case risk classification, no-train commitments, incident
  notification, model-change notice.
- Anthropic (40% enterprise LLM API spend), OpenAI (27%), others —
  diversifying enterprise LLM stack.
- Industry framing: "Enterprises will no longer ask which LLM to
  use. They'll ask how to build memory that is private, precise, and
  persistent."

**Recommended Foundation positioning:**

- Foundation makes LLM providers deployable in regulated enterprise /
  government environments where they otherwise couldn't go.
- Symbiotic, not adversarial: "We govern; you reason. We bring the
  customers; you bring the capability."
- Foundation = the substrate that makes harnesses, agents,
  applications governable.

**Recommended addition:** NEW ADR for LLM provider integration
architecture + scope work for explicit PII-stripping pipeline +
allowlist gateway component.

### 12.5 Scale architecture (billion-entity / trillion-capsule)

**Concern:** Foundation's correctness-first substrate needs forward
architecture for billion-entity / trillion-capsule / millions-of-
applications scale.

**Current state:**

- Substrate is correct, not yet scaled.
- ADR-0018 codifies deployment-target agnosticism (where) but not
  scale architecture (how big).
- Single-deployment scale ceiling not specified.

**Required architecture:**

- Capsule storage tiering (hot / warm / cold tiers).
- Audit chain partitioning (sharded by tenant or time).
- Capsule index sharding (likely tenant-scoped with cross-shard
  query coordinator).
- Cache invalidation strategy at scale (TAR hash invalidation across
  distributed cache).
- COSMP operation queue (write / audit operations queueable at
  scale).

**Recommended addition:** Scale architecture document (architectural
specification, not yet implementation). Future implementation work
after specification lands.

**Not a YC-readiness blocker.** Path to scale is demonstrable;
implementation is forward work.

### 12.6 Category positioning (AI Memory Governance Substrate)

**Concern:** Foundation is not a harness. It's the substrate that
harnesses run on. Needs explicit category positioning to differentiate
from agent harnesses (Claude Code, OpenClaw-style tools) and from
LLM providers' own moves into agent orchestration.

**Research findings (2026-05-08):**

- "Agent harness" definition: software infrastructure wrapping
  around an LLM, handling tool calls, memory management within
  session, multi-step orchestration.
- Harnesses are per-application infrastructure.
- Foundation is per-enterprise infrastructure (different layer).
- LLM providers all moving up the stack toward agent orchestration
  (OpenAI acquihire of OpenClaw creator signals this).

**Foundation's category claim:**

- "AI Memory Governance Substrate" (technical audience).
- "Supra Infrastructure for Autonomous Enterprises" (strategic
  audience; per Manifesto).
- First canonical implementation of patented protocol (COSMP) and
  storage architecture (DMW) for AI memory governance.
- Salesforce, Microsoft, Google, LLM providers do NOT have substrate
  at this layer — they have application-layer features approximating
  parts of it.

**Differentiators:**

- Patent-protected protocol (COSMP — 3 issued patents).
- Cryptographic memory ownership (enterprise owns wallet; LLM rents
  access).
- Append-only audit chain.
- Post-quantum-ready primitive selection.
- Deployment-target agnosticism.
- Multi-tenant kernel (with federation as Recommended Addition
  12.1).

**Recommended addition:** Strategic positioning document + explicit
category-claim language in CLAUDE.md and canonical reference.
Possibly external positioning materials (whitepaper, technical
brief, investor deck supporting documents).
